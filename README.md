# AI-driven-Cyber-Security-Framework

## Methodology
The systematic approach comprises three main components. First, an ensemble learning classification model is developed using the VCDB dataset, with its performance evaluated through k-fold cross-validation and benchmarked against other models. This quantitative method provides an objective assessment of an organization's cybersecurity posture based on historical data. Second, SHAP graphs are integrated to enhance explainability, allowing stakeholders to understand the factors influencing the model's decisions and fostering trust in high-stakes environments like critical infrastructure. Finally, Meta's Llama 3.1 8B Instruct LLM is fine-tuned on a custom cybersecurity dataset to translate risk predictions into actionable recommendations. This fine-tuned model is integrated with the GPT4ALL interface for ease of use and quantized for efficiency.

## Results
### Classification Model Results
The effectiveness of the cyber risk prediction model was assessed using the test dataset, representing 20% of the overall dataset. The model demonstrated high proficiency in classifying cyber threat types, achieving a classification accuracy of 90.81%.

### Explainability Results
The SHAP beeswarm plot visualizes the impact of each feature on the model's output across all samples. The horizontal axis represents the SHAP value, which indicates the contribution of a feature to pushing the modelâ€™s prediction higher (to the right) or lower (to the left). The colour gradient from blue to red represents the feature value, with blue indicating a low value and red indicating a high value.

The SHAP bar plot further quantified the average impact of each feature. It aggregates the SHAP values across all samples, providing the mean absolute SHAP value for each feature. This plot quantifies the average contribution of each feature to the model's predictions, regardless of direction (positive or negative).

### Policy Recommendation Model Results
The policy recommendation LLM was evaluated based on its ability to generate relevant, accurate, and applicable recommendations for various cyber risk scenarios. The evaluation process involved testing the model on a diverse set of scenarios representing different threat landscapes. The relevance, applicability, and coherence of responses were considered to assess the quality of the recommendations.
Examples of the recommendations generated by the LLM for different scenarios are illustrated below to provide an understanding of how the model performs.
